# Autohotkey Scripts

A collection of autohotkey scripts. I wrote some of the simpler ones. The more complicated scripts are borrowed and/or adapted from other sources.

## Run on startup

To make the scripts run on startup, move them to your startup folder. Mine is at

```
/c/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start\ Menu/Programs/Startup
```
